```

**Consumption States:**
- **Accelerating:** Full consumption rate
- **Idling:** Slower consumption (configurable interval)
- **Engine Off:** No consumption

---

### Refueling

**Method 1: Fuel Station Block**

**Process:**
```
1. Drive to fuel station
2. Right-click fuel station
3. Select fuel type (gasoline/diesel)
4. Pay from wallet
5. Tank filled automatically
```

**Cost:**
- Based on amount filled
- Price per liter configurable
- Paid to state account

---

**Method 2: Fuel Cans**

**Process:**
```
1. Fill fuel can at station
2. Right-click vehicle with full can
3. Transfer fuel to tank
4. Empty can returned
```

---

### Fuel Efficiency Tips

**Best Practices:**
```
✓ Use Industrial engine for best efficiency
✓ Choose appropriate chassis (smaller = better efficiency)
✓ Avoid constant acceleration
✓ Use Medium tank for balance
✓ Refuel before long trips
```

**Worst Efficiency:**
```

## Durability & Damage

### Damage System

**Range:** 0.0 to 100.0

**Damage Sources:**

| Source | Damage | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Collision** | Speed-based | 0-5× damage multiplier |
| **Water** | +25 | Engine stops immediately |
| **Lava** | +1 per tick | Continuous damage |

---

### Collision Damage

**Formula:**
```java
Speed Percentage = Current Speed / Max Speed

if (Speed % > 80%) {
    Damage = Speed % × 5

    if (Speed % > 90%) {
        Engine Stops
    }
}
```

**Examples:**
```
Max Speed: 10 blocks/sec
Current: 5 blocks/sec
Speed %: 50%
Result: No damage (< 80% threshold)

Current: 9 blocks/sec
Speed %: 90%
Damage: 90% × 5 = 4.5 damage
Engine: Stops (> 90%)

Current: 8.5 blocks/sec
Speed %: 85%
Damage: 85% × 5 = 4.25 damage
Engine: Still running
```

---

### Damage Effects

**Visual Effects (Particles):**

| Damage | Particles | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 0-49 | None | - |

## Driving Mechanics

### Speed System

**Speed Calculation:**
```
Max Speed = Engine Max × Chassis Max

Example:
Engine: Performance (1.3× multiplier)
Chassis: Limousine (1.0× base speed)
Max Speed: 1.3× chassis base

Result: Faster than normal engine
```

**Acceleration:**
```
Acceleration = Engine Accel × Chassis Accel

Example:
Engine: Performance (1.4× multiplier)
Chassis: Limousine (1.0× base accel)
Acceleration: 1.4× chassis base

Result: Faster acceleration
```

---

### Speed Display

**km/h Conversion:**
```java
km/h = |speed| × 20

Example:
Speed value: 0.5
km/h: 0.5 × 20 = 10 km/h

Speed value: 1.8
km/h: 1.8 × 20 = 36 km/h
```

---

### Controls

**Driving Controls:**

| Action | Default Key | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Forward** | W | Accelerate forward |
| **Backward** | S | Brake / Reverse |
| **Left** | A | Turn left |
| **Right** | D | Turn right |
| **Horn** | (Configurable) | Honk (costs 10 battery) |
| **Exit** | Shift | Leave vehicle |

---

### Handling

**Rotation Speed:**
- **Speed-dependent** - Faster = tighter turns
- **Min Rotation:** Chassis-defined
- **Max Rotation:** Chassis-defined

**Formula:**
```
Rotation = lerp(minRotation, maxRotation, speedPercent)

At low speed: Wider turns (min rotation)
At high speed: Tighter turns (max rotation)
```

---

### Physics

**Roll Resistance:** 0.02 (constant deceleration when not accelerating)

**Movement Calculation:**
```java
Motion X = sin(-rotationYaw × 0.017453292) × speed
Motion Z = cos(rotationYaw × 0.017453292) × speed
```

**Collision:**
- Entity detection
- Block collision
- Speed-based damage
- Crash sounds

---

## Vehicle Systems

### Temperature System

**Range:** 0°C to 150°C

**Temperature Factors:**
```
1. Biome Temperature (base)
   - Hot biomes: Higher base temp
   - Cold biomes: Lower base temp

2. Engine Running
   - Target: 90°C (optimal)
   - Hot biome: 100°C target
   - Cold biome: 80°C target

3. Speed
   - Higher speed = Higher temp
   - Air cooling effect
```

**Temperature Formula:**
```java
Biome Temp (°C) = (biomeTempValue - 0.3) × 30

Optimal Temp:
if (biomeTemp > 45°C) → 100°C (hot biome)
else if (biomeTemp <= 0°C) → 80°C (cold biome)
else → 90°C (normal)

Current Temp gradually moves toward optimal temp
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Vehicle Won't Start"

**Causes:**
1. No fuel
2. Damage = 100
3. Engine stopped from collision/water
4. Low battery
5. Missing engine part

**Solutions:**
```
1. Check fuel:
   - Open vehicle GUI
   - Check tank level
   - Refuel if empty

2. Check damage:
   - If 100: Repair or use repair kit
   - If < 100: Try starting again

3. Check battery:
   - Must have > 0 battery
   - Charge in garage

4. Check parts:
   - Garage GUI → Part inventory
   - Ensure engine present
```

---

### "Vehicle Slow/Poor Performance"

**Causes:**
1. Wrong engine type
2. High damage (slows vehicle)
3. Wrong tire type
4. Heavy chassis + weak engine

**Solutions:**
```
1. Upgrade engine:
   Normal → Performance
   +30% speed, +40% acceleration

2. Repair damage:
   High damage affects performance
   Repair in garage or with kit

3. Match tires to chassis:
   Truck → Heavy Duty
   Limousine → Sport
   Offroad → Offroad tires

4. Check part combinations:
   Heavy chassis needs strong engine
```

---

### "High Fuel Consumption"

**Causes:**
1. Performance engine (low efficiency)
2. Constant full-speed driving
3. Poor fuel type for engine
4. Large chassis

**Solutions:**
```
1. Switch to Industrial engine:
   Best fuel efficiency (1.2× multiplier)

2. Drive moderately:
   Avoid constant acceleration
   Coast when possible

3. Choose smaller chassis:
   Limousine uses less than Truck

4. Use larger tank:
   Fewer refuel stops
   More efficient long-term
```

---

### "Vehicle Damaged Instantly"

**Cause:** Water damage (+25 damage on water contact)

**Prevention:**
```
✓ Avoid water crossings
✓ Build bridges
✓ Use boats for water
✓ Plan routes around water

If in water:
1. Exit vehicle immediately
2. Push vehicle out of water
3. Repair damage in garage
```
