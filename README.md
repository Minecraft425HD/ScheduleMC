## Quick Start

### For Players

1. **Join the server.** Every new player receives a bank account with **1,000 Euro** starting balance.
2. **Open your smartphone** (configurable keybind, default: `P`) to access the Map, Bank, Contacts, and other apps.
3. **Find a plot.** Explore the city to find available plots. Plots come in types: Residential, Commercial, Shop, Public, and Government.
4. **Rent an apartment.** Use `/plot apartment rent <name>` to rent an apartment unit.
5. **Start earning money.** Sell items at shops, complete NPC quests, or start your own production business.
6. **Explore production.** Grow coffee, produce wine, brew beer, make chocolate, harvest honey, or age cheese -- all legally. Or take risks with illegal operations for higher profits.
7. **Buy a vehicle.** Visit a vehicle dealer, choose your chassis, engine, and tires, fuel up, and explore the city.
8. **Interact with NPCs.** Talk to residents, buy from merchants, and watch out for the police if your wanted level rises.
9. **Join a gang.** Create or join a gang with `/gang create <name>` or accept invitations, and claim territory.

### For Server Administrators

1. **Create the city layout.** Use the Plot Selection Tool (`/give @s schedulemc:plot_selection_tool`) to define plot boundaries by right-clicking two corners.
2. **Define plots.** Use `/plot create <name> <type>` to establish Residential, Commercial, Shop, Public, Government, Prison, and Towing Yard plots.
3. **Set up the economy.** Configure starting balance, tax rates, interest rates, and loan parameters in the config files under `config/schedulemc/`.
4. **Configure NPCs.** NPCs are placed as entities in-world. Use `/npc <name> schedule workstart 0700` to set their daily schedules, `/npc <name> speed <value>` to adjust movement, and `/npc <name> inventory` to manage their items.
5. **Configure production.** Set up which production chains are available and configure risk/reward balances.
6. **Set up warehouses.** Place warehouse blocks and link them to shop plots with `/warehouse setshop <shopId>`. Configure auto-delivery schedules.
7. **Configure the dynamic market.** Adjust supply/demand multiplier ranges and base prices through the market configuration.
8. **Establish police infrastructure.** Create Prison-type plots, set bail amounts, and configure wanted level decay and escape mechanics.
9. **Set up the hospital.** Use `/hospital setspawn` and `/hospital setfee <amount>` to configure respawn points and death costs.
10. **Test everything.** Use `/health` to run a comprehensive system health check across all subsystems (economy, plots, backups, etc.).

## API Overview

ScheduleMC exposes a comprehensive public API through the `ScheduleMCAPI` singleton class, providing 12 modules for external mod integration. The API uses a double-checked locking singleton pattern for thread-safe initialization and interface-based abstractions for clean separation between API contracts and internal implementations.

**API Entry Point:** `de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.ScheduleMCAPI`

### API Modules

| # | Module | Interface | Package | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Economy | `IEconomyAPI` | `api.economy` | Account management, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, balance queries |
| 2 | Plot | `IPlotAPI` | `api.plot` | Plot queries, ownership checks, protection status |
| 3 | Production | `IProductionAPI` | `api.production` | Production chain access, custom plant registration |
| 4 | NPC | `INPCAPI` | `api.npc` | NPC spawning, schedule management, dialogue, quests |
| 5 | Police | `IPoliceAPI` | `api.police` | Wanted level management, crime detection, prison |
| 6 | Warehouse | `IWarehouseAPI` | `api.warehouse` | Warehouse inventory, deliveries, stock queries |
| 7 | Messaging | `IMessagingAPI` | `api.messaging` | Player-to-player and system message sending |
| 8 | Smartphone | `ISmartphoneAPI` | `api.smartphone` | Custom app registration, push notifications |
| 9 | Vehicle | `IVehicleAPI` | `api.vehicle` | Vehicle spawning, fuel management, damage, customization |
| 10 | Achievement | `IAchievementAPI` | `api.achievement` | Achievement registration, progress tracking, rewards |
| 11 | Market | `IMarketAPI` | `api.market` | Price queries, supply/demand data, market events |
| 12 | PlotModAPI (legacy) | `PlotModAPI` | `api` | Legacy plot API for backward compatibility |

All API implementations reside in the `api.impl` package and are registered during mod initialization.

### Code Examples

**Getting the API Instance and Checking Status:**

```java
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.ScheduleMCAPI;

ScheduleMCAPI api = ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance();

// Check if all subsystems are initialized
if (api.isInitialized()) {
    System.out.println("ScheduleMC API v" + api.getVersion() + " is ready!");
    System.out.println(api.getStatus());  // Prints status of each subsystem
}
```

**Economy API -- Managing Player Funds:**

```java
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.economy.IEconomyAPI;
import java.util.UUID;

IEconomyAPI economy = ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance().getEconomyAPI();
UUID playerUUID = player.getUUID();

// Deposit 1000 Euro into a player's bank account
economy.deposit(playerUUID, 1000.0);

// Check balance
double balance = economy.getBalance(playerUUID);

// Transfer between players
economy.transfer(senderUUID, receiverUUID, 500.0);
```

**Plot API -- Querying Plot Information:**

```java
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.plot.IPlotAPI;
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.region.PlotRegion;
import net.minecraft.core.BlockPos;
import java.util.Optional;

IPlotAPI plots = ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance().getPlotAPI();

// Get the plot at a specific world position
Optional<PlotRegion> plot = plots.getPlotAt(new BlockPos(100, 64, 200));

plot.ifPresent(p -> {
    System.out.println("Plot: " + p.getName());
    System.out.println("Type: " + p.getType());
    System.out.println("Owner: " + p.getOwner());
});
```

**Production API -- Registering a Custom Plant:**

```java
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.production.IProductionAPI;

IProductionAPI production = ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance().getProductionAPI();

// Register a custom plant type for your addon mod
production.registerCustomPlant(/* your plant definition */);
```

**Police API -- Managing Wanted Levels:**

```java
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.police.IPoliceAPI;

IPoliceAPI police = ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance().getPoliceAPI();

// Get a player's current wanted level (0-5 stars)
int stars = police.getWantedLevel(playerUUID);

// Add wanted stars for a crime
police.addWantedLevel(playerUUID, 2);

// Clear wanted level (admin action)
police.clearWantedLevel(playerUUID);
```

**Market API -- Querying Dynamic Prices:**

```java
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.market.IMarketAPI;

IMarketAPI market = ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance().getMarketAPI();

// Get the current market price for an item
// Price includes supply/demand multiplier (0.5x to 2.0x base)
double price = market.getCurrentPrice(item);
```

**Smartphone API -- Registering a Custom App:**

```java
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.smartphone.ISmartphoneAPI;

ISmartphoneAPI smartphone = ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance().getSmartphoneAPI();

// Register a custom smartphone app from your addon mod
smartphone.registerApp(myCustomApp);
```

**NPC API -- Spawning and Configuring NPCs:**

```java
import de.rolandsw.schedulemc.api.npc.INPCAPI;

INPCAPI npcs = ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance().getNPCAPI();

// Spawn a merchant NPC at a location
npcs.spawnNPC(worldPosition, NPCType.MERCHANT, "Shop Owner Hans");
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

ScheduleMC maintains a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability across all major systems.

**Test Infrastructure:**

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Framework | JUnit 5 (Jupiter) 5.10.1 with parameterized test support |
| Mocking | Mockito 5.8.0 with `mockito-junit-jupiter` extension |
| Assertions | AssertJ 3.24.2 (fluent assertion chains) |
| Coverage | JaCoCo 0.8.11 (HTML + XML reports) |
| Test Files | 19 |
| Total Tests | 292 |
| Test Memory | 2 GB max heap (`maxHeapSize = '2G'`) |
| Test Logging | Passed, skipped, and failed events with full exception format |

**Coverage Requirements:**

| Scope | Minimum Coverage | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Global (all classes) | 60% line coverage | Baseline quality threshold |
| Utility classes (`de.rolandsw.schedulemc.util.*`) | 80% line coverage | Critical shared code requires higher coverage |

**Coverage Exclusions** (classes excluded from coverage requirements):
- Generated code (`**/generated/**`)
- Minecraft event handlers (`**/*Event*.class`) -- require running game server
- GUI classes (`**/client/gui/**`) -- require rendering context
- Block entities (`**/blockentity/**`) -- require Minecraft world instance

**Running Tests:**

```bash
# Run all unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests and generate JaCoCo coverage report
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport

# View the HTML coverage report
# Location: build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html

# Run coverage verification (enforces 60%/80% minimums)
./gradlew check

# Note: 'check' depends on 'jacocoTestCoverageVerification'
# which depends on 'test', so this runs everything
```

**Test Categories:**

| Category | Directory | What Is Tested |
|---|---|---|
| Command Tests | `src/test/.../commands/` | Command parsing, argument validation, execution logic |
| Economy Tests | `src/test/.../economy/` | Transaction processing, balance operations, loans, savings, tax, interest, anti-exploit |
| Production Tests | `src/test/.../production/` | Growth cycles, quality calculations, chain validation, serialization |
| Region Tests | `src/test/.../region/` | Plot CRUD, spatial index correctness, cache behavior, protection |
| Utility Tests | `src/test/.../util/` | Helper functions, data structures, event handling |
| Integration Tests | `src/test/.../integration/` | Cross-system interaction (economy + NPC, production + market) |
| Test Infrastructure | `src/test/.../test/` | Bootstrap classes for test environment setup |

**Built-In Health Check System:**

The mod includes a runtime health monitoring system (`HealthCheckManager`) accessible via the `/health` command. The health check monitors **38 subsystems** organized in 7 categories:

- **Kern-Systeme (3):** Economy, Plot, Wallet
- **Finanz-Systeme (9):** Loan, Credit Loan, Credit Score, Savings, Tax, Overdraft, Recurring Payments, Shop Accounts, Interest
- **NPC & Crime (5):** Crime, Bounty, NPC Registry, Prison, Witness
- **NPC Life (8):** Dialogue, Quest, Companion, Faction, NPC Interaction, NPC Relationship, World Event, Dynamic Price
- **Spieler-Systeme (7):** Gang, Territory, Achievement, Daily Reward, Messaging, Gang Mission, Scenario
- **Welt-Systeme (4):** Lock, Dynamic Market, Warehouse, Towing
- **Infrastruktur (2):** AntiExploit, ThreadPool

Each system reports HEALTHY, DEGRADED, or UNHEALTHY status. Use `/health <system>` for details on a specific subsystem, or `/health` for the full overview.
- Economy state is consistent (no negative balances, valid transactions)

**Quality Assurance Features:**

| Feature | Implementation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Automatic Backups | `IncrementalSaveManager` | Creates backups before every save operation |
| Corruption Recovery | Backup restoration | Auto-restores from last known good backup on load failure |
| Graceful Degradation | `EventHelper` | Individual system failures do not crash the entire mod |
| Error Isolation | Try-catch wrappers | Event handlers are isolated to prevent cascade failures |
| Atomic Writes | Temp file + rename | Save files are written atomically to prevent corruption |
| Input Validation | All command handlers | Commands validate all arguments before execution |
| Rate Limiting | `RateLimiter` | Prevents exploit attempts through rapid API calls |
| Anti-Exploit | `AntiExploitManager` | Detects and blocks common economy exploitation patterns |

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

**Q: The mod fails to load with a missing dependency error for CoreLib.**
A: CoreLib is a required dependency. Download [CoreLib 1.20.1-1.1.1](https://maven.maxhenkel.de/repository/public/de/maxhenkel/corelib/) and place the JAR file in your `mods/` folder alongside the ScheduleMC JAR. CoreLib provides essential functionality for OBJ model rendering, GUI systems, and networking.

**Q: Players cannot interact with blocks on their own plot.**
A: Verify the plot is correctly defined and the player is listed as the owner or member. Use `/plot debug` while standing on the plot to check ownership and boundaries. If the issue persists, check the server logs for `PlotProtectionHandler` messages. You can also run `/health plot` to verify the plot subsystem is healthy.

**Q: NPCs are standing still and not following their schedules.**
A: NPC schedules use HHMM format (e.g., `0800` for 8:00 AM, `1430` for 2:30 PM). Verify that schedule entries are set correctly with `/npc <name> info`. Additionally, ensure NPCs have valid home, work, and leisure locations set, and that pathfinding routes between those locations are not blocked by obstacles.

**Q: The economy system shows incorrect or inconsistent balances.**
A: Run `/health economy` to verify the economy subsystem is healthy. Check server logs for `AntiExploitManager` messages that might indicate blocked transactions. If a player's balance appears corrupted, admins can reset it with `/money set <player> <amount>`. The `TransactionHistory` can be reviewed to trace discrepancies.

**Q: A meth production block exploded and destroyed my base.**
A: This is intended behavior. The Reduction Vessel (Reduktionskessel) has a configurable chance of explosion during the reduction step. The explosion destroys the block and damages surrounding blocks in a radius. Always build meth labs in isolated locations away from valuable structures. The explosion risk is part of the risk/reward balance for methamphetamine production.

**Q: Vehicles are invisible or rendering incorrectly.**
A: Ensure CoreLib 1.20.1-1.1.1 is installed and matches the expected version. Vehicle models use OBJ format rendered through CoreLib's model system. If models appear invisible or distorted, try: (1) verifying CoreLib is the correct version, (2) reinstalling both mods, and (3) clearing your Minecraft shader cache. Check client logs for rendering errors.

**Q: The dynamic market shows all prices at 1.0x multiplier.**
A: The market system needs actual buy/sell transaction data to adjust prices. On a new server, all prices start at their base values (1.0x multiplier). As players buy and sell items, supply and demand data accumulates and prices will diverge from base values. The multiplier range is 0.5x to 2.0x.

**Q: How do I reset all mod data for a completely fresh start?**
A: Delete the `data/schedulemc/` directory inside your world save folder, then restart the server. This removes all economy, plot, NPC, crime, gang, territory, warehouse, and production data. Always create a backup of the world before doing this.

**Q: The smartphone screen is black or unresponsive.**
A: This is typically a client-side rendering issue. Verify you have the exact same mod version on both client and server. Try pressing the smartphone keybind again to close and reopen the interface. If the problem persists, check client logs for errors related to `SmartphoneScreen` or `SmartphoneNetworkHandler`.

**Q: Lock picking always fails on High Security and Dual locks.**
A: High Security locks have only a 10% pick success chance, and Dual Locks are even harder at 5%. This is by design to make these lock tiers meaningful security upgrades. Additionally, failed pick attempts on High Security and Dual Locks trigger an alarm that increases the picker's wanted level via the police system.

**Q: The Gradle build fails with OutOfMemoryError.**
A: Increase Gradle's JVM memory allocation in `gradle.properties`. The default is `-Xmx3G`. For machines with limited RAM, ensure at least 3 GB is available for the build process. Tests allocate up to 2 GB (`maxHeapSize = '2G'`). You may need `-Xmx4G` or higher if building alongside other memory-intensive processes.

**Q: How do I integrate my own mod with the ScheduleMC API?**
A: Add ScheduleMC as a `compileOnly` dependency in your `build.gradle`, then access the API at runtime via `ScheduleMCAPI.getInstance()`. Always check `isInitialized()` before calling any subsystem API, as ScheduleMC may initialize after your mod depending on load order. See the [API Overview](#api-overview) section for detailed code examples covering all 12 modules.

**Q: JEI/Jade/The One Probe integration features are not appearing.**
A: These mods are optional dependencies (`compileOnly` in the build). Ensure you have the correct compatible versions installed: JEI 15.2.0.27, Jade 11.8.0, or The One Probe 1.20.1-10.0.2. Integration is automatic when these mods are detected at runtime. Check that both ScheduleMC and the integration mod are loaded (visible in the Forge mod list).

**Q: The MDMA pill press timing minigame is too difficult.**
A: The pill press requires precise timing to produce high-quality pills. Missing the timing window degrades product quality but does not waste materials. Practice the timing rhythm -- the press has a visual and audio indicator for the optimal press moment. Administrators can adjust timing difficulty through the production configuration.

**Q: NPC witnesses keep reporting my crimes even when no one is around.**
A: NPCs have a detection radius for witnessing crimes. Even if you cannot see an NPC, one may be within detection range around a corner or inside a building. Use the Crime Stats smartphone app to see recent reports, and plan illegal activities in truly isolated areas away from NPC patrol routes and daily schedule locations.
